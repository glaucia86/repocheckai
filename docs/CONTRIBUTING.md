## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-command` - New features
- `fix/clipboard-issue` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-guide` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/improve-parser` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
feat: add /summary command for condensed reports
fix: resolve clipboard copy on Windows
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: simplify command parsing logic
chore: update dependencies
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and test locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   repocheck  # Test your changes
   ```

3. **Commit** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of your change"
   ```

4. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Update your branch** with latest changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push** your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes you made and why

4. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review your PR and may request changes

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define explicit types (avoid `any`)
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types from `src/domain/types/schema.ts`

### Code Style

- Use 2-space indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Keep lines under 100 characters

### File Organization

- One component/module per file
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`)
- Keep related code together

### Comments

- Document complex logic
- Use JSDoc for public functions
- Avoid obvious comments
